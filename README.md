### About What-to-do? App
I made this app for the times when my love and me cannot choose what to do or what to choose when we have more than one option. So this project exist because of the great work of Nick Downie (I mean Chart.js) and of course the best front-end framework Bootsrap. And I won't forget to thanks to the AngularJS team and their Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework which helped me to build it so fast and easy.
